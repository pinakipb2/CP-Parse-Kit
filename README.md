virtual env and requirements.txt


auto compile on file change auto start with logging (watchman.py)
check if output matched real output (judge.py) -> Show time taken

if corresponding .out file now found for input file leave the expected result (may do with shell) might provide inside folder(coding) for easy use -> maybe diff using shell will compile and check diff
If this is done then watchman.py might not be needed



pip freeze > requirements.txt

pip install -r requirements.txt

add dbrun.py cli tool to run from cli  {input -> (case insensitive)}
